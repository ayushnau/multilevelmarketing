            <div className="descriptionpara">
              Cordyceps is used by modern herbalists to reward healthy stamina
              and boost energy levels. Also known as Himalayan Gold, this
              caterpillar fungus is found predominantly in Himalayan alpine
              pastures. Keeda Jadi is how locals address this insect herb.
              Cordyceps grow at high altitudes and mature in the thick Himalayan
              foothills. Cordyceps is a highly valued ingredient in Ayurverda.
              Cordyceps was fed and eaten in ancient times as a diet and
              supplement. It is the world's most expensive fungus. Cordyceps
              Militaris is now grown commercially in laboratories for herbal
              remedies and supplements. Hence, it is vegan.
